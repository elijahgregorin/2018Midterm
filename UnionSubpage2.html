		<h1>Union Strategy</h1>
		<p>The Union's strategy involved 3 parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Defend Washington and attack Richmond, the Confederate's capital.</li>
				<li>Maintain a naval blockade on southern ports. This cut off southern trade</li>
				<li>Divide the Confederacy by it's main Water Routes.</li>
			<h1>Important Generals</h1>
			<h4>Abraham Lincoln</h4>	
				<p>There were multiple people who contributed to the victory of the Civil War. One would be Abraham Lincoln.
				Lincoln was the commander-in-chief of the military and the President of the Union. Also, he was in charge of
				putting new generals in charge of the army. Lincoln was assassinated just a few days after the war was over.</br></p>
			<h4>Ulysses S. Grant</h4>
				<p>Grant was the last general in charge of the Union Army. He was a famous general in the Civil War. He was resposible of
				the capture of Vicksburg. He also was the commanding general when they won the Battle at Shiloh. He would become out 18th President
				after Andrew Johnson.</p>
			<h4>George McClellan</h4>
				<p>George was the general of the Union Army, but only for a short time. This was because he did not want to fight unless
				he could win. He also ran for President, but lost to Lincoln.</p>
