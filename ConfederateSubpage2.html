		<h1>Confederate Strategy</h1>
		<p>The Confederates only had one strategy. This was to hold the war at a stalemate long enough for them to be recognized by the European countries. With the help of either England or France would make them win.</p>
		<h1>Important Generals</h1>
			<h4>Jefferson Davis</h4>
			<p>Jefferson Davis was the president of the Confederates. He was elected with his vice president, Alexander Stephens. When the Confederates lost, he ran to Atlanta, Georgia. He was captures, but no trila was held. 
			He was eventually pardoned by Andrew Johnson.</p>
			<h4>Robert E. Lee</h4>
			<p>Robert E. Lee was the General of the Confederate army. He actually didn't want to fight with the South and would have fought with the Union, if he didn't have to fight his home state, Virginia.
			So instead, he fought with the Confederates. His surrender to Grant was what ended the war.</p>
			<h4>Stonewall Jackson</h4>
			<p> Stonewall Jackson was also a general in the Confederate army. He was known for not giving up when the battle was looking bad. He also was mortally wounded by one of his own troops!</p>
